# BookBot

**BookBot** is my first project from **Boot.dev**! It's designed to analyze the text content of books and provide various statistics such as word count and character frequencies.

## Features
- **Word Count**: Analyzes the total number of words in the book.
- **Character Frequency**: Displays the frequency of each character in the book.

## Usage
To use the BookBot, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py <path_to_book>
```

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/grimoben/bookbot.git
cd bookbot
```
